Problem - 
The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, while revolutionary, presents significant challenges for participants, particularly in the DEX space.

Fragmented Data Across Blockchains:
  DEX activivty is spread across multiple blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, BNB chain, polygon and base.
  Traders and Investors struggle to find/access new projects, usually due to lack of visibility or network.

  Delayed and Inaccurate Insights:
  Existing platforms often provide delayed or incomplete data, making it hard to identify real-time opportunities. For instance,
  a token's trading volume might spike by 200% in 24 hours, but users may not notice because the project failed to trend in the top 30 
  on DEX's.

  Information Overload and Noise:
  The sheer volume of DeFi data creates noise, making it difficult to distinguish genuine trends from scams or short-lived pumps. 
  This is especially problematic for retail traders who lack the tools to find actionable insights.

Solution -
  Dex Trending tackles these challenges by providing a real-time, cross-chain analytics platform tailored for DEX users, 
  with the $DEXT token powering key functionalities and incentivising participation.

  Unified, Real-Time Data
  Dextrending aggregates transaction data from the DEXT bot.
  That's right! When a developer deploys our bot, the DEX Trending channel is gets an 
  announcement that the bot has been activated, supplying the CA and ticker.
  That way DEVs and investors alike can take full advantage of the Trending bot, minutes before the project hits top 30.
  First movers advantage for DEXT holders!

  Dex Trending answers the age old problem of a project not getting the visibility it deserves. 
  Let's be honest, if you're not CABAL, your project will never hit the front pages of Dexscreener, Dextools, and others.
  Dex Trending gurantees that visibility or your money back!
  Experience project success like never before with $DEXT Dex Trending!

  Accurate and precise delivery, Once the bot is actived our custom AI driven RPC nodes immediately begin 
  firing at all cyclinders to give the user a project experience they could never believe without experiencing it first hand.
